# Used Cars Price Analysis - Jupyter Notebook
# Overview
This project analyzes the factors influencing the price of used cars based on a dataset that includes various attributes. The primary goal is to uncover trends and relationships between car prices and variables like kilometers driven, transmission type, and more.

# Key Features
**Dataset Overview:**
- The dataset includes details about used cars, such as price, kilometers driven, and transmission type.
- The target variable is the price, measured in USD.

**Data Cleaning:**
- Missing values and irrelevant data were handled to prepare the dataset for analysis.

**Data Visualization:**
- Visualizations explore the relationships between price and other attributes.
- Example finding: Cars with automatic transmission tend to cost more than those with manual transmission, even for the same number of kilometers driven.

**Conclusions:**
- Transmission type significantly impacts car prices.
- Kilometers driven also correlate with the depreciation of value.

# Tools & Technologies
- **Jupyter Notebook:** Used for analysis and visualization.
- **Python Libraries:**
  - `pandas`: For data cleaning and manipulation.
  - `matplotlib` & `seaborn`: For data visualization.
  - `numpy`: For numerical operations.

# Insights & Conclusions
1) **Price Depreciation:**
   - As the number of kilometers driven increases, car prices tend to decrease, demonstrating a direct correlation between usage and depreciation.

2) **Transmission Type:**
   - Cars with automatic transmission are generally priced higher than manual transmission cars, even when they have driven similar distances.

3) **Other Factors:**
   - Certain unaccounted variables like brand, age, and condition may also play a role in determining prices, as observed in some outliers.

4) **Overall Trend:**
   - Price trends align with expectations, but additional analysis could provide deeper insights into brand and region-specific factors.
